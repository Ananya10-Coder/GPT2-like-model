GPT-2-like Model from Scratch
This project implements a simplified version of the GPT-2 model from scratch using PyTorch. It includes training the model on a small subset of the WikiText-2 dataset, fine-tuning it on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis, applying Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF), and generating text for evaluation.

Introduction
The goal of this project is to build, train, and fine-tune a GPT-2-like model from scratch. The model is trained on a small subset of the WikiText-2 dataset for language modeling, fine-tuned on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis, and improved using Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF). Finally, the model is evaluated by generating text and computing performance metrics.

Steps
The project is divided into five steps:

Step 1: Build a GPT-2-like model from scratch.

Implement token and positional embeddings, multi-head self-attention, feedforward layers, and layer normalization.

Step 2: Train the model on a small subset of WikiText-2.

Train the model to predict the next token in a sequence using the WikiText-2 dataset.

Step 3: Fine-tune the model on a small subset of IMDB.

Adapt the model for sentiment analysis by fine-tuning it on the IMDB dataset.

Step 4: Apply Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF).

Improve the model's text generation by aligning it with human preferences using RLHF.

Step 5: Generate text and evaluate the model's performance.

Generate text using the fine-tuned model and evaluate its performance on a test dataset.

Requirements
To run this project, you need the following:

Python 3.x

torch (PyTorch)

transformers (Hugging Face Transformers library)

datasets (Hugging Face Datasets library)

numpy

tqdm (for progress bars)

stable-baselines3 (for RLHF)

gymnasium (for RLHF environment)

A CUDA-capable GPU (optional but recommended for faster training)

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/gpt2-from-scratch.git
cd gpt2-from-scratch
Set up a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install torch transformers datasets numpy tqdm stable-baselines3 gymnasium
Usage
Run the script:

bash
Copy
python gpt2_from_scratch.py
Steps performed by the script:

Build a GPT-2-like model from scratch.

Train the model on a small subset of WikiText-2.

Fine-tune the model on a small subset of IMDB.

Apply RLHF to align the model with human preferences.

Generate text and evaluate the model's performance.

Output:

Training and fine-tuning loss/accuracy metrics.

Generated text samples.

Evaluation metrics (e.g., loss, accuracy).

Results
After running the script, you will see output similar to the following:

Copy
Training Loss: 1.2345, Accuracy: 0.5678
Fine-tuning Loss: 0.3456, Accuracy: 0.7890
Generated Text: "I really enjoyed this movie because..."
Evaluation Metrics: Loss: 0.1234, Accuracy: 0.9012
This demonstrates the model's ability to generate coherent and relevant text and its performance on the test dataset.
